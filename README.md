# 🚀 SentinelFlow AI

### Autonomous Multi-Agent Enterprise Workflow Orchestrator

---

## 🧠 Overview

SentinelFlow AI is an **enterprise-grade multi-agent system** designed to autonomously execute complex business workflows with built-in:

* 🔄 Self-healing error recovery
* 🧾 Full auditability
* 🧠 AI memory & learning
* 📊 Workflow monitoring

Unlike traditional automation systems, SentinelFlow AI **does not stop on failure** — it detects issues, adapts, and continues execution intelligently.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Enterprise workflows (e.g., vendor payments, onboarding, contract processing) are:

* Fragmented across multiple systems
* Dependent on manual intervention
* Prone to failures and delays

👉 When a single step fails, the entire workflow stops — causing SLA breaches and inefficiency.

---

## 💡 Solution

SentinelFlow AI introduces a **multi-agent architecture** where specialized AI agents collaborate to:

* Plan workflows
* Validate actions
* Execute tasks
* Detect and recover from failures
* Learn from past executions

👉 Result: **Autonomous, reliable, and self-improving workflows**

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture

| Agent        | Responsibility                     |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| 🏗 Architect | Breaks goal into workflow steps    |
| 🔍 Auditor   | Validates compliance & correctness |
| ⚙ Executor   | Executes actions                   |
| 🛡 Sentinel  | Handles failures & retries         |
| 🧠 Historian | Stores memory & improves decisions |
